---

### Record a transaction: `transact`

## Notes About Command Format
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` represent parameters supplied by the user.
    * *Example:* `addItem d/NAME q/QUANTITY`
* Parameters prefixed with letters (e.g., `d/`, `q/`) must be included exactly as shown.
* Parameters can be provided in any order unless stated otherwise.
* Commands are **case-insensitive**. Typing `add` and `ADD` will both execute the same action.
* **INDEX** refers to the number shown in the displayed item list and must be a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...).

---

## Smart Features
Before diving into the standard commands, here are a few built-in features to make your life easier:
* **Command Autocompletion:** You don't have to type the full command! Just type the first few letters (e.g., `add`) and press the `Tab` key to auto-complete it to `addItem`.
* **Typo Suggestions:** If you accidentally misspell a command (e.g., `deletItem 1`), InventoryBRO will automatically catch it and ask: *"Do you mean deleteItem?"*

  Item edited:
  1. new Coke Can (Quantity: 200)

  > editItem 1 n/Coke Can q/50 
  Item edited:
  1. Coke Can (Quantity: 50)
  ```
  ### 4. Viewing All Items: `listItems`
Displays a numbered list of all items currently in your inventory.

* **Format:** `listItems`
* **Example Output:**
  ```text
  Here are your current inventory items:
  1. Coke Can (Quantity: 50)
  2. Sprite Bottle (Quantity: 30)
  3. Potato Chips (Quantity: 20)
  ```

### 5. Finding an Item: `findItem`
Searches for items whose descriptions contain your specified keyword. This is case-insensitive.

* **Format:** `findItem KEYWORD`
* **Example:** `findItem coke`
* **Expected Output:**
  ```text
  Here are the matching items in your inventory:
  1. Coke Can (Quantity: 50)
  ```

### 6. Filtering Items: `filterItem`
Displays only the items that match one or more field-based predicates. Predicates can be combined using `AND` (both must match) and `OR` (either must match). `AND` binds tighter than `OR`.

Supported fields and value types:

| Field | Operators | Value format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `description` | `=` `<` `>` | Text enclosed in **single quotes** (e.g. `'Coke'`) |
| `quantity` | `=` `<` `>` | Non-negative integer (e.g. `10`) |
| `price` | `=` `<` `>` | Non-negative integer (e.g. `5`) |

* **Format:** `filterItem FIELD OPERATOR VALUE [AND|OR FIELD OPERATOR VALUE ...]`
* **Example 1 (single predicate):** `filterItem quantity > 10`
  ```text
  Here are the filtered items:
  1. Coke Can (Quantity: 50, Price: $0.00)
  2. Potato Chips (Quantity: 20, Price: $0.00)
  ```
* **Example 2 (AND — both conditions must hold):** `filterItem quantity > 10 AND quantity < 40`
  ```text
  Here are the filtered items:
  1. Potato Chips (Quantity: 20, Price: $0.00)
  ```
* **Example 3 (OR — either condition matches):** `filterItem description = 'Coke Can' OR description = 'Sprite Bottle'`
  ```text
  Here are the filtered items:
  1. Coke Can (Quantity: 50, Price: $0.00)
  2. Sprite Bottle (Quantity: 30, Price: $0.00)
  ```
* **Example 4 (price filter):** `filterItem price < 5`
  ```text
  Here are the filtered items:
  1. Potato Chips (Quantity: 20, Price: $2.00)
  ```
* **No match output:**
  ```text
  No items match the given filter.
  ```

> **Note:** Description values must always be wrapped in single quotes. Quantity and price values must be whole numbers — decimals are not accepted.

### 7. Recording a Transaction: `transact`
Updates the stock quantity after a sale or restock.
* Use a **negative number** for a sale.
* Use a **positive number** for a restock.

* **Format:** `transact INDEX q/CHANGE_IN_QUANTITY`
* **Example 1 (Sale):** `transact 1 q/-5`
  ```text
  Transaction recorded.
  Coke Can new quantity: 45
  ```
* **Example 2 (Restock):** `transact 2 q/10`
  ```text
  Transaction recorded.
  Sprite Bottle new quantity: 40
  ```

### 8. Getting Help: `help`
Displays a quick-reference list of all available commands, or provides detailed instructions and examples for a specific command.

* **Format 1 (General Summary):** `help`
    * **Example:** `help`
    * **Expected Output:** Displays a list of all commands (`addItem`, `deleteItem`, `editItem`, etc.) along with a short summary of what each one does.

* **Format 2 (Detailed Instruction):** `help COMMAND_NAME`
    * **Example:** `help addItem`
    * **Expected Output:**
      ```text
      addItem:
      Adds a new item of a given name and quantity to the current inventory list.
  
      Example usage: addItem d/Apples q/10
      This adds an item named 'Apples' of quantity '10' to the inventory list.
      ```

* **Format:** `help`

### 9. Exiting the Program: `exit`
Safely closes the application.

* **Format:** `exit`
* **Expected Output:**
  ```text
  Exiting InventoryBRO.
  Goodbye!
  ```

## Saving Data
InventoryBRO automatically saves your data to the hard disk whenever:
* An item is added
* An item is deleted
* A transaction is recorded

There is **no need to manually save**. Data is stored seamlessly in `./data/inventorybro.txt`. If the folder or file does not exist, InventoryBRO will automatically create it for you upon startup.

---

## Command Autocompletion

InventoryBRO includes a built-in tab-completion engine so you never have to remember or fully type a command keyword.

**How it works:**
* Type the first few letters of any command and press the `Tab` key.
* If only one command matches your prefix, it is completed immediately.
* If multiple commands match, a list of candidates is shown for you to choose from.

**Examples:**

| You type | You press | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `add` | `Tab` | Completes to `addItem` |
| `del` | `Tab` | Completes to `deleteItem` |
| `li` | `Tab` | Completes to `listItems` |
| `f` | `Tab` | Shows `filterItem`, `findItem` |

**Things to know:**
* Autocompletion only works on the **command keyword** (the first word). It does not attempt to complete arguments like item names or indices.
* Autocompletion is only available when running the application directly from the JAR file (`java -jar inventorybro.jar`). It is **not** available when running via `./gradlew run` because Gradle pipes stdin, which disables raw terminal mode.
* Matching is **case-insensitive** — typing `ADD` and pressing `Tab` will still complete to `addItem`.

---

## Typo Detection

If you accidentally misspell a command, InventoryBRO will attempt to detect the mistake and suggest the closest valid command rather than silently failing.

**How it works:**
* When you enter an unrecognised command, InventoryBRO compares it to all known commands using a keyboard-aware edit-distance algorithm. Keys that are physically adjacent on a QWERTY keyboard are treated as more similar than keys that are far apart, so common slip-of-the-finger mistakes are caught more reliably.
* If a close enough match is found, you are prompted with a suggestion. Otherwise, the full list of valid commands is shown.

**Examples:**

| You type | InventoryBRO responds |
| :--- | :--- |
| `adItem d/Coke q/5` | `Do you mean addItem?` |
| `deletItem 2` | `Do you mean deleteItem?` |
| `lsitItems` | `Do you mean listItems?` |
| `eixt` | `Do you mean exit?` |

**Things to know:**
* The suggestion is a hint only — you still need to re-enter the corrected command yourself.
* Very short or highly scrambled inputs may not produce a suggestion if no known command is close enough.
* Typo detection runs automatically on every unrecognised input. There is nothing to configure.

| **Edit item** | `editItem INDEX (n/NAME) (q/QUANTITY)` | `editItem 2 n/New Coke Name` |
